# The file order to complete this lesson:

# 1. Familarize yourself with the three lib/15 files.
#    - lib/15a_binary_game
#    - lib/15b_binary_search which is based on 14_find_number
#    - lib/15c_random_numer
# 2. Look at spec/15b_binary_search_spec which is based on 14_find_number_spec
# 3. Complete spec/15a_binary_game_spec

# This spec file is for the BinarySearch class that is used by the BinaryGame
# class. These tests were written in the last lesson. The FindNumber class
# has been renamed to BinarySearch, which is a more accurate description.
# Note that BinaryGame is going to let the user decide between inputting a
# random number and having the computer generate one using the
# RandomNumber class. This means that the RandomNumber double is no longer
# needed for this spec file.
