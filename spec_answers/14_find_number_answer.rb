# For this lesson you will be doing TDD for 3 methods: #make_guess,
# #make_guess, and #update_range.

# After you have some experience using TDD, you can use the typical
# Red-Green-Refactor workflow.
# https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/red-green-refactor-by-example

# Since this is probably your first experience with TDD, let's extend the
# workflow to include a few more steps:
# 1. Read & understand the requirement for one method only.
# 2. Write one test for that method that you think it will pass.
# 3. Write the method to fulfill the requirement.
# 4. Run the test that you wrote. If it doesn't pass, re-do steps 1-3.
# 5. When your first test is passing, write the additional tests.
# 6. Run all of the tests. If any do not pass, re-do steps 3-5.
# 7. Optional: Refactor your code and/or tests, keeping all tests passing.

  # ASSIGNMENT: METHOD #1

  # The basic idea of 'FindNumber' is to program a computer to guess a
  # random_number using binary search. Remember the binary search video
  # that you watched in the Computer Science section:
  # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T98PIp4omUA

  # The computer will update min and max values to help find the correct number.

  describe '#make_guess' do
    # Create a random_number double & allow it to receive 'value' and return any
    # number between 0 and 9, in one of the two ways explained above.

    let(:random_number) { double('random_number', value: 8) }
    subject(:game) { described_class.new(0, 9, random_number) }

    # Before you write the #make_guess method:
    # Write a test that would expect #make_guess to return the average of
    # the min and max values (rounded down). Don't expect this test to be
    # able to pass as you haven't written #make_guess yet!

    # Now write a method in 14_find_number.rb called #make_guess that returns
    # the average of the min and max values (rounded down).
    # You can now run the above test and it should pass.
