# The file order to complete this lesson:
# 1. Familarize yourself with the two classes in lib/13_input_output.rb
# 2. Complete spec/13_input_output_spec.rb

# Ruby code that was written before you learned how to use RSpec may be nearly
# impossible to test. For example, in the lib/13_input_output file, there are
# two identical games: ImpossibleToTestGame and NumberGame. Take a look at each
# game and look for differences that may make one easier or harder to test
# than the other.

# One key difference between the two is that NumberGame has smaller,
# isolated methods.

# Small and isolated methods that only do one thing are easier to test.
# Long methods are like a run-on sentence that should have been divided into 2 or 3 different sentences so that everything could be clearly understood and in this case if a method does many different things it can be difficult to test.

# So if you are new to testing, be open to refactoring your previous
# code, to make writing tests easier. As you learn testing, you will also
# learn how to write better testable methods.

# The tests in this file are longer than those in the previous lessons.
# To get your bearings, remember to reference the following lines:
# describe -> Name of the method that is being tested.
# context ->  Explains the conditions of the test.
# it ->       Explains the results of the test.
